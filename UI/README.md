# Library Phase Four
This assignment was part of my software development apprenticeship program. It is the fifth and final part of a multi-phase project in which I created a full-stack library application.

## Overview
The final phase the library application involved the implementation 
of authorization and a UI to support the authentication functionality 
previously built on the back-end. In phase V, I integrated components from 
phases III and IV, while building additional functionality for the log-in 
process, private routes, and managing sessions.  Phase V is the result of 
integrating the front-end that I built with React-Redux and the back-end 
that I built with Express, while using a Google Firestore database.
